## Contributing to Zed
Thanks for your interest in contributing to Zed, the collaborative platform that is also a code editor!

Read on if you're looking for an outline of your first contribution - from finding your way around the codebase and asking questions, through modifying and testing the changes, finishing off with submitting your changes for review and interacting with Zed core team and Zed community as a whole.

### Getting in touch
We believe that journeys are best when shared - hence there are multiple outlets for Zed users and developers to share their success stories and hurdles.

If you have questions, ask them away on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XTtXmZYEpN) or in a dedicated [Zed channel](https://zed.dev/preview/channel/open-source-81). We also plan to organise office hours on a weekly basis - they will take place in forelinked channel.

### Bird-eye's view of Zed
Zed is made up of several smaller crates - let's go over those you're most likely to interact with:
- [gpui](/crates/gpui) is a GPU-accelerated UI framework which provides all of the building blocks for Zed.
- [editor](/crates/editor)
- [project](/crates/project)
- [workspace](/crates/workspace)
- [vim](/crates/vim)
- [lsp](/crates/lsp)
- [language](/crates/language)
- [rpc](/crates/rpc)
- [collab](/crates/collab)


### Upstreaming your changes
Here be dragons :)
